I launched and managed a pilot of [Crossfeed](https://docs.crossfeed.cyber.dhs.gov/), an open-source software tool used for securing public-facing election infrastructure in advance of the 2020 election, and worked on vulnerability notifications for affected entities during the pilot. We used cloud technologies such as AWS Fargate, AWS Lambda, and Elasticsearch. We worked with a small team of contractors and software developers to develop the product.
